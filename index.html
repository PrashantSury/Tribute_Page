    <h4>Early Life</h4>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Shivaji was born in the hill-fort of Shivneri, near the city of Junnar in what is now Pune district. </li>
      <li>Scholars disagree on his date of birth. The government of Maharashtra lists 19 February as a holiday commemorating Shivaji's birth (Shivaji Jayanti). Shivaji was named after a local deity, the goddess Shivai.</li>
      <li>Shivaji's father Shahaji Bhonsle was a Maratha general who served the Deccan Sultanates. His mother was Jijabai, the daughter of Lakhuji Jadhavrao of Sindhkhed, a Mughal-aligned sardar claiming descent from a Yadav royal family of Devagiri.</li></ul></>
  
  <h4>Upbringing</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Shivaji was devoted to his mother Jijabai, who was deeply religious</li>
    <li>His studies of the Hindu epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, also influenced his lifelong defence of Hindu values.</li>
    <li>Shivaji was deeply interested in religious teachings, and regularly sought the company of Hindu and Sufi saints.</li>
    <li>Many of Shivaji's comrades, and later a number of his soldiers, came from the Maval region, including Yesaji Kank, Suryaji Kakade, Baji Pasalkar, Baji Prabhu Deshpande and Tanaji Malusare</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Rest Of Life</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>He combated so many wars and made victory. Some of them I want to list out here are as: Siege of panhala, Battle of Pavan Khind, Battle of Singhgad, Battle of Torana, Attacks on Shaista Khan and Surat,etc
</li>
   <li>In his rest of the life had conquered so many combat and from victory he had built a swaraj in mahrashtra and made people proud of him and grateful to him for the rest of the era.</li>
    <li>And people say about him as "People's King" and in honor of him we all say "Jai Shivaji,Jai Bhavani"</li>
